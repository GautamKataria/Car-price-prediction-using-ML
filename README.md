# Car-price-prediction-using-ML

#### The aim of this repository is to show you how to make a highly accurate ML model for car price prediction.

#### The ML model uses hyperparameter training to improve its accuracy.

#### The model was trained on a car price Kaggle dataset [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv)

#### This repository also contains the necessary files to deploy this model using Heroku
